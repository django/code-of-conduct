# Django Code of Conduct Communications Guidelines

When communicating with reporters and subjects of the report, it's important to
keep the following in mind:

## Protect reporters

- Protecting reporters is our first priority. Never forward communication or
  disclose identities of reporters outside of the code of conduct committee,
  without the express written permission of the person concerned.
- If adding or removing people from the recipients list of an email thread, note
  the change at the top of the email, like this:

  > [+ Maya]
  > [- Alex]

  this helps guard against someone accidentally sharing protected information
  without being aware of the recipients.

## Anonymizing Reports

When communicating with administrators, moderators, or the reported party,
carefully anonymize all identifying information about the reporter and
witnesses:

- Remove or redact names, usernames, and email addresses
- Generalize specific timestamps that could identify participants
- Describe observable behaviors without quoting unique phrasing that could
  identify sources
- Use gender-neutral language unless gender is relevant to the incident

When drafting communications, have a second working group member review for
potentially identifying information before sending.

## Communicate professionally

- Different people will experience the same situation in different ways.
  Use specific, factual language that describes observable behaviors and their
  impact rather than making assumptions about intent or internal states. This
  trauma-informed approach helps all parties understand what occurred while
  minimizing further harm.
- Always cc <conduct@djangoproject.com> on communication, or forward replies that
  had the address removed.

## Engaging with reported parties

- All parties involved deserve to be heard. People who are the subject of reports
  should have an opportunity to respond before we finalize our decision. This
  doesn't mean disclosing reporter identities or minimizing the harm caused, but
  rather engaging them in a fair process. A transparent process that respects
  everyone's dignity leads to better outcomes and fewer disputes.

- Keep the primary goal centered: creating a safer, more welcoming community for
  everyone. This means focusing on accountability, understanding impact, and
  supporting behavior change rather than simply punishing individuals. This
  restorative approach shapes more effective interventions.

- In many cases, directly requesting that someone not attend Django events or
  refrain from certain behaviors can be effective. When approached with clarity
  about expectations and consequences, many individuals will voluntarily comply.

## Structure of Communication with Reported Parties

When contacting someone about a Code of Conduct violation, the communication
should include four components:

1. **Description of behavior in neutral language**: State what occurred using
   factual, observable terms without assumptions about intent
2. **Impact of that behavior**: Explain the negative effects on individuals
   and/or the community
3. **Behavioral modifications expected**: Provide concrete, specific expectations
   for changed behavior going forward (if applicable)
4. **Consequences**: Clearly state what consequences are being applied and
   what may happen if the behavior continues

Do not disclose who reported the incident. If the person wishes to apologize
to someone harmed, the working group can facilitate this or accept the apology
on their behalf, but direct contact should be discouraged unless all parties
consent.

## Sharing information about reported parties

Sharing information with other community leaders or making information public may
be necessary when the community remains at risk despite private interventions.

When deciding to share information about individuals who have violated the Code
of Conduct, there is potential for claims of slander, libel, defamation of
character, and reputational damage. In serious cases we should seek legal advice.
The following approaches mitigate this risk:

- Whenever possible, work to corroborate reports with multiple sources or
  identify patterns of behavior. This enables us to:
  1. Describe patterns of behavior rather than isolated incidents, which provides important context for protective actions.
  2. Protect individual reporters by not centering any single report.

- There's an important distinction between providing information and directing
  action. If we instruct event organizers "Don't invite this person," we become
  directly responsible for any reputational consequences. However, if we inform
  organizers that a person has been the subject of Code of Conduct reports
  relating to specific types of incidents, while leaving the final decision to
  them, the DSF is providing information to help them make informed decisions
  about their events.

- All information sharing must be documented in writing rather than through
  video calls or voice conversations. When informing community organizers about
  individuals who have violated the Code of Conduct, communicate via email using
  precise, factual language that makes clear they are empowered to make their
  own decisions based on the information provided.

- Strict adherence to our established processes is essential. Any claims of
  improper handling will examine whether we followed our documented procedures
  consistently and fairly.

## Communicating about repair and accountability

Aligned with Contributor Covenant 3.0's focus on repairing harm, our
communications should emphasize accountability, growth, and community healing.

- **Focus on impact, not intent.** When discussing violations with reported
  parties, center the conversation on the harm caused rather than debating their
  intentions. Acknowledge that harm can occur even when unintended.

- **Be clear about expectations.** Communicate specific, actionable expectations
  for behavior change. Vague requests like "be better" are less effective than
  concrete guidance such as "Do not contact Jin directly; communicate only
  through the working group."

- **Support accountability.** When appropriate enforcement actions include
  opportunities for repair (such as apologies or acknowledgment of
  responsibility), provide guidance on what meaningful accountability looks like.
  This might include acknowledging the specific harm caused, demonstrating
  understanding of the impact, and committing to behavior change.

- **Use trauma-informed language.** Avoid language that minimizes harm ("just a
  misunderstanding") or blames those who were harmed ("they were too sensitive").
  Use person-first language that separates the behavior from the individual's
  identity.

- **Respect everyone's dignity.** Even when addressing serious violations,
  communicate in ways that preserve the humanity of all involved. This doesn't
  mean avoiding consequences, but rather implementing them with respect and
  clarity.

- **Provide appropriate context for repair actions.** When communicating repair
  actions to reporters or the broader community, explain how they address the
  harm and support community safety without unnecessarily disclosing private
  details.
