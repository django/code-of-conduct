# Django Code of Conduct

## Structure of membership in the committee

Members of the committee are all volunteers, and we're always aiming to have
high representation of people coming from different places and backgrounds.
There is no set number of people required to be on the committee at the moment.
Committee tries to keep the number as small as possible due to sensitivity of
the matter, but big enough to achieve diversity of the views and fast response
time to incoming reports.

Whenever there is a need to add new members, committee reviews proposals from
people who volunteered thus far but are not on the committee yet. If that
number is still too low, a call for volunteers is published on Django blog.

### Current members of the committee:

- Brian Moloney, Co-Chair
- Jeff Triplett, Co-Chair
- Erik Romijn, Vice Chair
- Mike Barkas
- Olumide Bakare
- Amber Brown (Hawkowl)
- Joseph V. Cardenas
- Michael Clark
- Tibbs Hefflin
- Anna Makarudze
- Frank Wiles (DSF board observer)

### Past members of the committee:

- Greg Turner
- Paul Hallett
- Emily Karungi
- Ola Sitarska
- Baptiste Mispelon
- Lacey Williams Henschel
- Rebecca Conley

### Terms of membership:

Starting on 25th May, 2016, committee decided to introduce fixed-term
membership. Each member of the committee is only obligated to serve on the
committee for a fixed period of time, with 6-9 months being a default term. The
idea behind it allows members of the committee to step down from serving
without feeling guilty, and assumes an opt-in membership instead of opt-out, as
it was thus far.

| Member                | Join date        | Length of term | Next opt-in date   |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Amber Brown (HawkOwl) | January 5th 2015 | 6 months       | May 25th 2017      |
| Jeff Triplett         | May 5th 2016     | 6 months       | December 5th, 2017 |
| Brian Moloney         | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | October 31st 2017  |
| Sasha Romijn          | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | October 31st 2017  |
| Mike Barkas           | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | October 31st 2017  |
| Olumide Bakare        | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | October 31st 2017  |
| Joseph V. Cardenas    | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | October 31st 2017  |
| Michael Clark         | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | October 31st 2017  |
| Tibbs Hefflin         | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | October 31st 2017  |
| Anna Makarudze        | February 1, 2017 | 9 months       | October 31st 2017  |

After the membership term ends, the invitation to stay in the committee is
automatically extended, but member has to confirm they're indeed still
interested and have time to serve on the committee (opt-in).
