# Django Code of Conduct

## Structure of membership in the committee

Members of the committee are all volunteers, and we're always aiming to have high representation of people coming from different places and backgrounds. There is no set number of people required to be on the committee at the moment. Committee tries to keep the number as small as possible due to sensitivity of the matter, but big enough to achieve diversity of the views and fast response time to incoming reports.

Whenever there is a need to add new members, committee reviews proposals from people who volunteered thus far but are not on the committee yet. If that number is still too low, a call for volunteers is published on Django blog.

### Current members of the committee:

- Greg Turner
- Amber Brown (Hawkowl)
- Paul Hallett
- Emily Karungi
- Ola Sitarska
- Baptiste Mispelon
- Jeff Triplett
- Frank Wiles (DSF board observer)

### Terms of membership:

Starting on 25th May, 2016, committee decided to introduce fixed-term membership. Each member of the committee is only obligated to serve on the committee for a fixed period of time, with 6 months being a default term. The idea behind it allows members of the committee to step down from serving without feeling guilty, and assumes an opt-in membership instead of opt-out, as it was thus far.

| Member                | Join date         | Length of term | Next opt-in date   |
|:----------------------|:------------------|:---------------|:-------------------|
| Greg Turner           | January 5th 2015  | 6 months       | November 25th 2016 |
| Amber Brown (HawkOwl) | January 5th 2015  | 6 months       | November 25th 2016 |
| Paul Hallett          | January 5th 2015  | 6 months       | November 25th 2016 |
| Emily Karungi         | February 4th 2015 | 6 months       | November 25th 2016 |
| Ola Sitarska          | May 5th 2016      | 6 months       | November 25th 2016 |
| Baptiste              | May 5th 2016      | 6 months       | November 25th 2016 |
| Jeff Triplett         | May 5th 2016      | 6 months       | November 25th 2016 |

After the membership term finishes, the invitation to stay in the committee is automatically extended, but member has to confirm they're indeed still interested and have time to serve on the committee (opt-in).
