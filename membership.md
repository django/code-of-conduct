# Django Code of Conduct Working Group Membership

## Structure of membership in the working group

Members of the working group are all volunteers, and we're always aiming to have
high representation of people coming from different places and backgrounds.
There is no set number of people required to be on the working group at the moment.
The working group tries to keep the number as small as possible due to sensitivity of
the matter, but big enough to achieve diversity of the views and fast response
time to incoming reports.

Whenever there is a need to add new members, the working group reviews proposals from
people who volunteered thus far but are not on the working group yet. If that
number is still too low, a call for volunteers is published on Django blog.
