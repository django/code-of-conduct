# Django Code of Conduct Working Group Membership

## Structure of membership in the working group

Members of the working group are all volunteers. Consistent with [Django's commitment to diversity](https://www.djangoproject.com/diversity/), the working group actively seeks members who bring diverse perspectives, including:

- People from different geographic regions where Django is used
- People from marginalized groups who understand challenges community members may face
- Different levels of involvement in Django (core developers, contributors, users, event organizers)
- Relevant skills such as conflict resolution, community management, or trauma-informed care

The working group keeps the number as small as possible due to sensitivity of the matter, but large enough to achieve diversity of views and fast response time to incoming reports.

Whenever there is a need to add new members, the working group reviews proposals from
people who volunteered thus far but are not on the working group yet. If that
number is still too low, a call for volunteers is published on Django blog.

## Member terms

Starting on 25th May, 2016, working group decided to introduce fixed-term membership.
Each member of the working group is only obligated to serve on the working group for a
fixed period of time, with 6-9 months being a default term. The idea behind it allows
members of the working group to step down from serving without feeling guilty, and
assumes an opt-in membership instead of opt-out, as it was thus far.

In February 2026, the working group updated our terms to be annual. Every January the
chair or vice-chair will ask members if they would like to continue for another term.
If a member does not respond within a week, they will be removed from the working group.
If a member wants to step down, they can do so at any time by notifying the chair
or vice-chair.

Members who do not participate over a 90 day period without prior notification to the
chair or vice-chair will be removed from the working group during the next regular
meeting. Participation includes any mix of attending meetings, responding to emails
or Slack messages, or contributing to the working group's documentation or processes.

## Advisers to the working group

Advisers provide specialized expertise to support the working group's decision-making
but are not voting members. Advisers may be consulted on specific cases or policy
decisions where their expertise is relevant.

Advisers may bring specialized knowledge in areas such as:

- Legal expertise related to defamation, privacy, or employment law
- Mental health and trauma-informed response
- Human resources and workplace conflict resolution
- Community management and restorative justice practices
- Cultural competency for specific communities or regions

Advisers are required to abide by the same confidentiality and privacy guidelines
as voting members of the working group. They have access to working group
communications and case materials only as needed for their advisory role, and
must recuse themselves from matters where they have a conflict of interest.

Currently, the working group has no advisers.
