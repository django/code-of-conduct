# Django Code of Conduct Update Procedures

This document serves as a template for how to propose substantive changes to Django's
Code of Conduct and related documentation. The Working Group can bypass this process
for minor edits such as typos and formatting issues; for updating membership lists; and
for editing FAQs as necessary.

## Proposing Changes

Any member of the Django community may propose changes to the Code of Conduct docs.
Proposals should be made by opening an issue on the [Django Code of Conduct
repository](https://github.com/django/code-of-conduct/) with a clear description of the
proposed change and the rationale behind it. Ideally the proposer will also update the
CHANGELOG.md file with a brief summary of the proposed change; or the Working Group
will do so upon approval of the change.

Proposals that themselves are deemed to violate the Code of Conduct will be rejected
by the Working Group. Repeated attempts to propose such changes may result in
enforcement actions as described in the Code of Conduct documentation, including
banning from community spaces like our GitHub organization.

## Reviewing Changes

The Working Group will review proposed changes as they are submitted. Any open issues
will be discussed during the Working Group's regular meetings. The Working Group may
also solicit feedback from the broader Django community on proposed changes, either
through public discussion threads or by other means like our Discord or DSF Slack.

Everyone is encouraged to participate in these discussions while adhering to the
Code of Conduct (keep it positive, constructive, and respectful).

## Approving Changes

Once the Working Group has reached consensus on a proposed change, the change will be
merged into the Code of Conduct documentation. The Working Group will then update the
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file to reflect the change, including a brief description
of the change and the date it was made.

Changes to the Code of Conduct itself will be set to the DSF Board for final approval
before being merged. Changes to related documentation may be merged directly by the
Working Group.

## Announcing Changes

After a change has been merged, the Working Group will announce the change to the
Django community. This may be done through the Django blog, mailing lists, social media,
or other channels as appropriate. The announcement will include a summary of the change,
the rationale behind it, and any relevant links to the updated documentation.

## Changelog

This document should be updated whenever a change is made after this
documentation will be made public. This is to transparently show how and what
changes to the documentation are made without forcing people through the
experience of looking at commit log. This may also include summary of rationale behind
a change.
