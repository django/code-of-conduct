# Django Code of Conduct Support for Event Organizers

The Django Code of Conduct is committed to providing a safe, harassment-free
environment for all Django events.

As an event organizer, it's best that you set up a Code of Conduct committee
that will handle any Code of Conduct violations at the event. It's very
important that your attendees feel and are protected at your event.

Establishing and enforcing Code of Conduct at events is not easy. Here is how
Django Code of Conduct Working Group can help event organizers to ensure safe
environments at events.

## Before the event

- We advise that you share the list of attendees with us such that we are able to
  check it against our list of individuals who have violated the Code of Conduct.
  If any of the attendees appears on our list as flagged or banned, we will inform
  you about this.

- Similarly, before you announce your accepted speakers, you can send us the
  speaker list to see if any appear on our lists.

- Note that we can only tell you whether or not someone appears in our records
  as flagged or banned. We don't guarantee that people have never violated
  a Code of Conduct, as we won't inform you of minor incidents, and records of
  minor incidents are expunged after some time. We also don't do any research
  beyond our own lists.

- If you have any trouble with setting up a Code of Conduct policy for your event,
  reach out to us and we will be able to help you through the process of creating
  one.

## During the event

- If you encounter a Code of Conduct violation at your event that needs to be
  addressed immediately, you can reach out to us and we will try to help you
  through the process of resolving it.

## After the event

Events in the Django community are strongly encouraged to keep reports
on all Code of Conduct incidents they handle, and send these reports to the
working group after the end of the event. Reports should include names
of people involved and, ideally, a description of the facts determined by
the event team, the review of the incident, actions taken, and responses
to actions taken. We also appreciate any screenshots of original slack or
twitter messages, or recordings of talks, that show the violation, and
copies of message exchanges between the team and any reporters or reported parties.

Upon receiving reports from an event, the working group will:

- Confirm receipt of the reports to the event.
- Review all reports.
- Assess whether any additional action from the working group is needed.
- Record all reports in the working group's records.

Reporting any (even resolved) Code of Conduct
violations to us helps us create one, central record of incidents to help make all
events safer.

### Transparency Report Guidelines

Publishing a transparency report after the event concludes is a critical step
for building trust within the community and ensuring the community that any issues
that have been reported have been handled in an appropriate manner.

This guide is provided for event organizers. We particularly hope it is
useful for Conference Chairs and Code of Conduct responders.

Note that this is the public-facing summary transparency report. For operational purposes, an event should also
keep private records of all reports and issues at the event, which should be shared with the Django Code of Conduct Working Group.

#### When to release

A timely report helps everybody:

- Reporters know that their reports were taken seriously;
- Attendees can see that Code of Conduct reports are an integral part of the event and so feel confident to
  attend in the future and report issues they themselves witness;
- Organizers demonstrate strong commitment to follow their stated goals and
  procedures.

Since it's important to be able to recall details of covered issues accurately,
a timely report will be of higher quality.

Releasing an initial transparency report should be part of the closing ceremony.
Following up with affected parties might take time after the event. Therefore,
a separate complete report can be provided in writing at a later time. It
shouldn't take more than a month after the event to close the loop on the final report.

#### How to publish

An initial in-person report during the closing ceremony is highly recommended. Any information available by
that time, including statistics on the number of reports, will be very valuable
to attendees at the event. Cases that need following up shouldn't block the
initial report from being presented.

After the event, any official communication channel used with the attendees is a good option for letting people know a transparency
report is available. Examples include:

- Official website for the event;
- Official blog for the event and/or organization behind it;
- Newsletter or mailing list(s) in use around the event.

#### What to include

Starting with some general information about the event puts all data in context.
Include the size of the event, with separate numbers for in-person and online attendees, if applicable.
Briefly describe the reporting process: who the people enforcing the Code of Conduct and responding to reports were, how an
attendee could report a Code of Conduct issue, and where this information was available for
attendees to find.

The main part of the report will be the statistics of reports received (including past 3-5 years historical statistics can be helpful for
comparison) and the report status/progress for each report.

If there was a post-event survey asking attendees about their confidence in
reporting issues, the results of that survey can be included in the following
year's transparency report.

#### What NOT to include

Make sure the transparency report does not include any sensitive information
such as the names or any identifiable information of the reporters and the reported
people. In the event that law enforcement was called, you should say they were
called and not make further comments on the details as it could adversely affect
official action.
