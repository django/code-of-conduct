# What is django/code-of-conduct?

This repository is used by Django Software Foundation Code of Conduct committee to transparently describe how the committee enforces the Code of Conduct for Django community. It's our internal set of documentation with processes that drive our work that we decided to make public with an aim to:

- keep ourselves accountable to the community
- offer Django community an insight into how decisions are made and issues are dealt with
- help other tech communities not only establish, but also enforce their Code of Conduct
- improve our processes with feedback received from the wider tech community

## Contributing to this repository

Please use issues or pull requests to suggest changes to this documentation, as well as to our process. We welcome feedback of all kind, but remember to be respectful. If you would rather provide feedback privately, please do so by contacting us on conduct@djangoproject.com.

While contributing ideas and feedback, please keep in mind that this is still our internal documentation, so suggesting concepts that work well for other communities may not directly translate to our work.
