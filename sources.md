The Django Code of Conduct and related enforcement materials draw upon the work of many communities and organizations who have developed thoughtful approaches to creating safe, inclusive spaces.

## 2026 Revision Sources

In 2026, we substantially revised our enforcement materials to incorporate best practices from:

### Python Software Foundation

- [PSF Code of Conduct](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/)
- [PSF Code of Conduct Working Group Enforcement Procedures](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/Enforcement-Procedures/)

These materials provided structured frameworks for evaluating reports (jurisdiction, impact, risk), detailed privacy and documentation procedures, and guidance on behavioral modification plans versus consequences.

## Additional Influences

Over the years, we have also learned from:

- [Django Project Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/) (original version)
- [Geek Feminism Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/)
- Various community management and restorative justice practices
- Trauma-informed response frameworks
- The lived experiences of our working group members and community members who have made reports

## Our Commitment

We believe in building on the work of others while adapting materials to meet Django's specific needs as a global, distributed community. We share our work under open licenses so others may benefit from and improve upon what we've learned.
