# Django Code of Conduct - Reporting Guide

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you
report it to the Django Software Foundation by emailing
<conduct@djangoproject.com>. All reports will be kept confidential. In
some cases the DSF Board may determine that a public statement will need
to be made. If that's the case, the identities of all affected parties
and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct
us otherwise.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate
law enforcement first.** If you are unsure what law enforcement agency
is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt
to notify them.

## Understanding When to Report

Not every conflict or disagreement represents a Code of Conduct
violation. Tensions can occur between community members even when they
are trying their best to collaborate in good faith. Differences of
opinion, technical disagreements, and communication challenges are normal
parts of working together. However, violations often occur in how we
respond to these disagreements. It's acceptable to question the merit of
a technical decision, but it's not acceptable to question the merit or
value of the people who made that decision.

If you are unsure whether an incident is a violation, or whether the
space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage
you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports
where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an
actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the
incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not
violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve
the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.

## Who Can Report

You do not need to be directly affected by an incident to report it. If
you witness or become aware of behavior that violates the Code of
Conduct, we encourage you to report it, even if you were not the target
of the behavior.

## Language Accessibility

While reports can be submitted in any language, please note that the
working group primarily operates in English. If you use translation tools
to prepare your report, please let us know so we can keep that in mind
during our evaluation. We will make every effort to work with reports
submitted in any language.

## What to Include in Your Report

In your report please include:

- Your contact information (so we can get in touch with you if we need
  to follow up)
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If
  there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as
  well.
- When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as
  possible.
- Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record
  (e.g. a forum post) please include a link.
- Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
- If you believe this incident is ongoing.
- Any other information you believe we should have.

## Confidentiality and Privacy

The working group is committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy
of all individuals involved in Code of Conduct matters.

Reports and the identity of reporters will be kept confidential to the
extent possible. The working group will not share reporter identities
with the reported party. However, in some situations, context may allow
individuals to infer who made a report.

Personal information is:

- Stored securely with access limited to working group members handling
  the specific report
- Used only for the purpose of investigating and resolving reports
- Retained in accordance with the Django Software Foundation's data
  retention policies and applicable privacy laws
- Protected in accordance with applicable data protection regulations

For details on how records are maintained, see the Record Keeping section
below.

## Protection From Retaliation

Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith is itself
a violation of this Code of Conduct and will be treated seriously. If you
experience retaliation after making a report, please report that as well.

## What Happens After You File a Report

You will receive an email from the DSF Code of Conduct Working Group
acknowledging receipt. The working group strives to respond promptly,
recognizing that as volunteers, coordination may take time. The working
group will keep you informed of progress and any delays.

The working group will immediately meet to review the incident and
determine:

- What happened.
- Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
- Who the bad actor was.
- Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to
  anyone's physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical
safety, the working group's immediate priority will be to protect
everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response until
we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is physically
safe.

### Ongoing Incidents and Immediate Action

Examples of ongoing incidents include: someone continuing to engage in
harassment on a forum, persistent unwelcome contact, or any situation
where harmful behavior is actively continuing.

For ongoing situations or threats to safety, working group members may
act immediately (before reaching consensus) to protect community members.
This can include temporarily restricting someone's access to certain
spaces or requiring they avoid contact with specific individuals. See our
[Enforcement Manual](enforcement.md) for more details on how we handle
urgent situations.

### Investigation and Resolution

The working group aims to have an initial response to you within one week
of receiving your report, though we recognize that complex cases may take
longer. We will keep you informed throughout the investigation process.

The working group must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the working
group cannot reach consensus within a reasonable timeframe, the working
group will turn the matter over to the board for resolution.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events, they will
make a decision as to how to respond using our [Enforcement
Ladder](enforcement-ladder.md). The enforcement ladder includes responses
ranging from warnings to permanent bans, with the goal of repairing harm
while considering the incident's impact on individuals and the community.
Depending on the severity of a violation, lower levels may be skipped.

### Your Input on the Resolution

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the working
group will contact you and any other affected parties to explain the
proposed resolution. The working group will ask if this resolution is
acceptable, and will note your feedback for the record.

However, the working group is not required to act on this feedback. The
final decision rests with the working group, using their best judgment to
balance the needs of the affected parties with the safety and health of
the broader community.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact you to let you know
what action (if any) we'll be taking.

Finally, the Working Group will make a report on the situation to the DSF
board. The board may choose to issue a public report of the incident.

## If Your Report Concerns a Working Group Member

### Conflicts of Interest

Any member of the working group must immediately notify the other members
in writing (by disclosure on the report email thread) and recuse
themselves from handling a report if they:

- Are involved in the incident itself
- Have a personal relationship with any involved party
- Work for the same employer as an involved party
- Have access to private information that could bias their judgment
- Have any other conflict of interest that could affect their
  impartiality

If your report concerns a current member of the Code of Conduct working
group, you may not feel comfortable sending your report to the working
group, as all members will see the report.

In that case, you can make a report directly to any or all of the current
chairs of the Code of Conduct working group. Their email addresses are
listed on the [Code of Conduct working
group](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#code-of-conduct-team)
page. The chairs will follow the usual enforcement process with the other
members, but will exclude the member(s) that the report concerns from any
discussion or decision making.

If your report concerns all current chairs of the working group, please
send your report directly to the DSF board at
<foundation@djangoproject.com> instead.

## Reconsideration

Any of the parties directly involved or affected can request
reconsideration of the working group's decision. To make such a request,
contact the DSF Board at <foundation@djangoproject.com> with your request
and motivation and the DSF board will review the case.

## Transparency and Public Accountability

The working group will never publicly discuss specific incidents. All
public statements about individual Code of Conduct matters will be made
by the DSF board, if deemed necessary.

However, to demonstrate that the Code of Conduct is being actively and
fairly enforced, the working group will publish annual transparency
reports including anonymized statistics such as:

- Number of reports received
- Types of violations reported
- General outcomes (warnings, suspensions, bans)
- Any trends or patterns observed

These reports will be prepared in a way that protects the confidentiality
of all involved parties while providing community accountability.

## Record Keeping

### Record Retention

The working group maintains records of all information and communications
related to incident reports, including:

- Initial reports and all communications with reporters
- Investigation materials and evidence
- Email discussions and documented deliberations
- Notes and key takeaways from meetings
- Decisions made in DSF Slack (recorded into meeting notes)
- Communications with all involved parties
- Final resolutions and any follow-up actions

Records are retained in accordance with the Django Software Foundation's
data retention policies and applicable privacy laws.

### Access to Records

All members of the working group involved in handling a specific incident
report have access to all records related to that report. This ensures
informed decision-making. The board may request access to records for
oversight purposes.
