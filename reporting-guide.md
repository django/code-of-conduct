# Django Code of Conduct - Reporting Guide

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct we ask that you
report it to the Django Software Foundation by emailing
<conduct@djangoproject.com>. **All reports will be kept confidential.**
In some cases we may determine that a public statement will need to be
made. If that's the case, the identities of all victims and reporters
will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

**If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate
law enforcement first.** If you are unsure what law enforcement agency
is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt
to notify them.

If you are unsure whether the incident is a violation, or whether the
space where it happened is covered by this Code of Conduct, we encourage
you to still report it. We would much rather have a few extra reports
where we decide to take no action, rather than miss a report of an
actual violation. We do not look negatively on you if we find the
incident is not a violation. And knowing about incidents that are not
violations, or happen outside our spaces, can also help us to improve
the Code of Conduct or the processes surrounding it.

In your report please include:

- Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to
  follow up)
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If
  there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as
  well.
- When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as
  possible.
- Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record
  (e.g. a forum post) please include a link.
- Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
- If you believe this incident is ongoing.
- Any other information you believe we should have.

### What happens after you file a report?

You will receive an email from the DSF Code of Conduct Working Group
acknowledging receipt immediately. We promise to acknowledge receipt
within 24 hours (and will aim for much quicker than that).

The working group will immediately meet to review the incident and
determine:

- What happened.
- Whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation.
- Who the bad actor was.
- Whether this is an ongoing situation, or if there is a threat to
  anyone's physical safety.

If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to physical
safety, the working group's immediate priority will be to protect
everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official" response
until we believe that the situation has ended and that everyone is
physically safe.

Once the working group has a complete account of the events they will
make a decision as to how to response. Responses may include:

- Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).
- A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s)
  involved.
- A public reprimand.
- An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from
  the forum).
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Django spaces (the
  forum, etc.)
- A request for a public or private apology.

We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report with
either a resolution or an explanation of why the situation is not yet
resolved.

Once we've determined our final action, we'll contact the original
reporter to let them know what action (if any) we'll be taking. We'll
take into account feedback from the reporter on the appropriateness of
our response, but we don't guarantee we'll act on it.

Finally, the Working Group will make a report on the situation to the
DSF board. The board may choose to a public report of the incident.

### What if your report concerns a possible violation by a working group member?

If your report concerns a current member of the Code of Conduct working
group, you may not feel comfortable sending your report to the working
group, as all members will see the report.

In that case, you can make a report directly to any or all of the
current (vice/co) chairs of the Code of Conduct working group. Their
e-mail addresses are listed on the [Code of Conduct working
group](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#code-of-conduct-team)
page. The chairs will follow the usual enforcement process with the
other members, but will exclude the member(s) that the report concerns
from any discussion or decision making.

If your report concerns all current (vice/co) chairs of the working
group, please send your report directly to the DSF board at
<foundation@djangoproject.com> instead.

### Reconsideration

Any of the parties directly involved or affected can request
reconsideration of the working group's decision. To make such a request,
contact the DSF Board at <foundation@djangoproject.com> with your
request and motivation and the DSF board will review the case.
