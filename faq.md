# Django Code of Conduct - FAQ

This FAQ attempts to address common questions and concerns around the Django community's [Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/). If you still have questions after reading it, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:conduct@djangoproject.com).

## Why have you adopted a Code of Conduct?

We think the Django community is awesome. If you're familiar with the Django community, you'll probably notice that the Code basically matches what we already do. Think of this as documentation: we're taking implicit expectations about behavior and making them explicit.

We're doing this because the Django community is growing faster than any of us could have anticipated. This is on balance a very positive thing, but as we've grown past the point where it's possible to know the whole community we think it's very important to be clear about our values.

We know that the Django community is open, friendly, and welcoming. We want to make sure everyone else knows it too.

## What does it mean to "adopt" a Code of Conduct?

For the most part, we don't think it means large changes. We think that the text does a really good job describing the way the Django community already conducts itself. We expect that most people will simply continue to behave in the awesome way they have for years.

However, we do expect that people will abide by the spirit and words of the CoC when in "official" Django spaces. This code has been adopted by both the Django core team and by the Django Software Foundation. That means that it'll apply both in community spaces _and_ at DSF events.

In practice, this means the Django forum, bug tracking and code review tools, and "official" Django events such as DjangoCons. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

## Why did Django adopt [Contributor Covenant 3](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/)?

In 2026, Django updated its Code of Conduct for the first time since 2014. After a year of discussion about how best to update our CoC, [we were inspired by the BeeWare Project's adoption of Contributor Covenant](https://github.com/beeware/.github/pull/254) and recognized it as a strong foundation for Django's needs.

We chose Contributor Covenant 3 because:

- [It has been broadly adopted by similar scale projects and organizations, providing a proven framework](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/adopters/)
- It [more clearly outlines](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/#our-pledge) who we seek to protect in our community, in line with our [DEI values](https://github.com/django/.github/blob/main/DEI.md)
- It provides clearer examples of both [encouraged](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/#encouraged-behaviors) and [discouraged](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/#restricted-behaviors) behaviors, making expectations more explicit
- It includes a well-defined [enforcement ladder](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/#addressing-and-repairing-harm) focused on repairing harm and progressive responses

## What about events funded by the Django Software Foundation?

This Code of Conduct also covers any events that the DSF funds. However, events funded by the DSF already [require a code of conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/). Isn't this redundant?

No: there's a difference between the two, and they're complementary.

This Code of Conduct is all about how we interact as a community. It's about saying that the Django community will be open, friendly, and welcoming. The core issue is about ensuring the conversations we have are productive and inviting for all.

Real-life events, however, require a bit more care. The DSF wants to be sure that any events it funds have policies and procedures in place for handling harassment. It's especially important to us that real-life events take steps to protect the physical and mental security of their participants.

So the DSF will require that any events it funds have some sort of anti- harassment policy in place. The DSF thinks the [Ada Initiative's template](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) is pretty good, but we're open to alternatives.

## What happens if someone violates the Code of Conduct?

Our intent is that anyone in the community can stand up for this code, and direct people who're unaware to this document. If that doesn't work, or if you need more help, you can contact [conduct@djangoproject.com](mailto:conduct@djangoproject.com). For more details please see our [Reporting Guidelines](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/reporting/).

When a violation is reported, the Code of Conduct Working Group investigates and determines an appropriate response using an [enforcement ladder](enforcement-ladder.md). This approach focuses on repairing harm and responding proportionally to the severity of the violation. The ladder has four levels: Warning, Temporary Suspension (Short-term), Temporary Suspension (Extended), and Permanent Ban as a last resort.

Each level includes opportunities for the person who violated the code to repair harm, reflect on their actions, and demonstrate changed behavior. The working group may skip levels depending on the severity of a violation. For instance, someone won't be permanently banned for a single mistake, but serious or repeated violations are addressed seriously to keep the community safe.

## Who enforces the Code of Conduct?

The [Code of Conduct Working Group](membership.md) is responsible for investigating reports and enforcing the Code of Conduct. The working group is appointed by the Django Software Foundation board and operates according to the procedures documented in the [Working Group Manual](working-group-manual.md).

For day-to-day moderation in Django's online spaces (like the forum and Discord), the [Online Community Working Group](https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/online-community.md) handles issues using their own moderation processes. The Code of Conduct Working Group becomes involved for formal reports, cross-community violations, or issues escalated by the online moderators.

Contributor Covenant refers to "Community Moderators" as a general term for whoever enforces a code of conduct. In Django, that role is filled by these two working groups, each with distinct but complementary responsibilities.

## What does "repairing harm" mean?

Repairing harm is a restorative justice approach that focuses on addressing the impact of a violation rather than simply punishing the person who caused it. When someone violates the Code of Conduct, our goal isn't just to apply consequences—it's to help make things right for those affected and prevent similar harm in the future.

Repairing harm might include:

- Acknowledging what happened and taking responsibility for your actions
- Providing a sincere apology to those affected
- Reflecting on how your behavior impacted others, even if harm wasn't intended
- Demonstrating understanding of what behavior changes are needed
- Following through on commitments to change behavior

This approach recognizes that people can learn from mistakes and that communities are stronger when we focus on growth, accountability, and making amends rather than purely punitive measures. Of course, some violations are severe enough that removal from the community is necessary to protect others, but that's a last resort.

## Why do we need a Code of Conduct? Everyone knows not to be a jerk.

Sadly, not everyone knows this.

However, even if everyone was kind, everyone was compassionate, and everyone was familiar with codes of conduct it would still be incumbent upon our community to publish our own. Maintaining a code of conduct forces us to consider and articulate what kind of community we want to be, and serves as a constant reminder to put our best foot forward. But most importantly, it serves as a signpost to people looking to join our community that we feel these values are important.

## What should I do if I've been accused of violating the Code of Conduct?

If you are contacted by the Code of Conduct Working Group about a possible violation, it's important to respond professionally and constructively:

- **Stay calm and professional.** Do not respond with sarcasm, attack the Code of Conduct itself, or criticize the person who reported the concern.
- **Focus on the facts.** Clearly describe what happened from your perspective, sticking to objective details rather than interpretations or assumptions.
- **Listen and reflect.** Work to understand any harm you may have caused, even if that wasn't your intention. Impact matters more than intent.
- **Consider how to repair harm.** Think about what you can do to make things right and prevent similar issues in the future.
- **Cooperate with the process.** Work with the working group as they evaluate the report. If you disagree with their decision, you may ask about the appeal process.

The working group's goal is to respond proportionally to violations and work with everyone involved to prevent future issues. We want to maintain a safe, collaborative community of kind, compassionate people of all kinds.

## Can someone be removed for behavior outside Django spaces?

The Code of Conduct applies to all Django-managed spaces and when someone is officially representing Django. However, as stated in the [Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/), violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

This means that while we don't police behavior everywhere on the internet, the working group may consider serious external conduct when it directly impacts the safety and well-being of Django community members.

## This is censorship! I have the right to say whatever I want!

You do -- in _your_ space. If you'd like to hang out in _our_ spaces (as clarified above), we have some simple guidelines to follow. If you want to, for example, form a group where Django is discussed using language inappropriate for general channels then nobody's stopping you. We respect your right to establish whatever codes of conduct you want in the spaces that belong to you. Please honor this Code of Conduct in our spaces.
