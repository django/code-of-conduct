# Django Code of Conduct

On 31st July 2013, [Django community adopted a Code of
Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/jul/31/django-adopts-code-of-conduct/).
This documentation aims to transparently describe how the Django Code of Conduct
committee enforces the Code of Conduct and how it all works behind the scenes.

There is still a lot we're figuring out and learning as we go, so we don't
consider this documentation to be finished or complete. However, we hope it's
going to be useful base for other communities to not only adopt, but also
implement and enforce the Code of Conduct.
