# Django Code of Conduct Statistics

In the spirit of transparency, we're sharing numbers of Code of Conduct
violations that were reported to the Code of Conduct Working Group in the recent
years.

These statistics are compiled on an ongoing basis by the Code of Conduct Working Group.

_Note: This format was updated in 2026 to include more detailed information about the
outcomes of the reports. The previous format only included the total number of reports
and people named. Some of the numbers have changed as part of that process because of
historically redacted and incomplete data. Additionally some years were previously
reported by when the issue was resolved and are now reported by when the issue
was received._
