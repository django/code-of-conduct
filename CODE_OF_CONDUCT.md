# Django Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates in good faith and in accordance with this Covenant.

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, we all strive to meet our community's expectations for positive behavior. We also understand that our words and actions may be interpreted differently than we intend based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, we agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center our shared values, including:

1. Respecting the **purpose of our community**, our activities, and our ways of gathering.
2. Engaging **kindly and honestly** with others.
3. Respecting **different viewpoints** and experiences.
4. **Taking responsibility** for our actions and contributions.
5. Gracefully giving and accepting **constructive feedback**.
6. Committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs.
7. Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain the **well-being of our community**.

**Impact matters more than intent.** Even when harm is unintentional, we are all responsible for the impact of our words and actions. If someone tells you that your behavior has caused harm, listen with empathy and take responsibility for making things right.

**Respect consent and boundaries.** Consent is an ongoing process, not a one-time agreement. Respect others' stated boundaries, and be mindful that silence or lack of objection does not equal consent. If someone says "no," asks you to stop, or sets a boundary, respect it immediately and without debate.

**Community members are expected to comply immediately with requests to stop harmful behavior.** This includes requests from other community members, moderators, or the Code of Conduct Working Group. Refusal to comply may result in escalated enforcement actions.

## Restricted Behaviors

We agree to restrict the following behaviors in our community. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors are violations of this Code of Conduct.

1. **Harassment.** Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop. This includes persistent unwanted questioning (sea-lioning), coordinated harassment or brigading, tone policing, and other patterns of behavior designed to exhaust, intimidate, or silence community members.
2. **Character attacks.** Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
3. **Stereotyping or discrimination.** Characterizing anyone’s personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
4. **Microaggressions.** Subtle, often unintentional behaviors or comments that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative attitudes toward marginalized groups. While individual instances may seem minor, their cumulative effect causes real harm.
5. **Sexualization.** Behaving in a way that would generally be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
6. **Violating confidentiality**. Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information without their permission. This includes doxxing (publicly sharing private information), unwelcome recording or photography, and logging online activity for harassment purposes.
7. **Endangerment.** Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.
8. **Discouraging involvement.** Acting in ways that discourage others' involvement, such as trying to exploit technicalities, repeatedly arguing against already made decisions, or questioning others' abilities or intents.
9. Behaving in other ways that **threaten the well-being** of our community.

### Other Restrictions

1. **Misleading identity.** Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
2. **Failing to credit sources.** Not properly crediting the sources of content you contribute.
3. **Promotional materials**. Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that is outside the norms of the community.
4. **Irresponsible communication.** Failing to responsibly present content which includes, links or describes any other restricted behaviors.
5. **Violating community guidelines.** Failing to follow community guidelines for any space covered by the [Online Community Working Group](https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/online-community.md) or a sponsored event's own Code of Conduct.
6. **Retaliation.** Taking adverse action against someone for reporting a violation of this Code of Conduct or participating in an investigation.

### Weapons Policy

To ensure the safety and comfort of all attendees, weapons are not allowed at Django events. We recognize that the presence of weapons can make community members feel unsafe, particularly those who have experienced trauma.

Prohibited items include but are not limited to: explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others.

If you are found to be in possession of a weapon, event staff will ask you to remove it from the venue. You may return to the event once the weapon has been secured elsewhere. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a safe space for everyone.

## Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a code of conduct violation, and this Code of Conduct reinforces encouraged behaviors and norms that can help avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is important to report it promptly. Please see our [Reporting Guide](reporting-guide.md) for detailed information on how to report a possible violation and what to expect during the process.

The Code of Conduct Working Group takes reports of violations seriously and will make every effort to respond in a timely manner. They will investigate all reports, which may include reviewing relevant messages, logs, and recordings, or interviewing witnesses and other participants. All evidence is handled with care and respect for privacy, and access is limited to those directly involved in the investigation. The Code of Conduct Working Group will keep investigation and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while prioritizing safety and confidentiality. In order to honor these values, enforcement actions are carried out in private with the involved parties, but communicating to the whole community may be part of a mutually agreed upon resolution.

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

When a Code of Conduct violation occurs, the Code of Conduct Working Group uses an enforcement ladder to determine appropriate responses based on the severity and context of the violation. The goal is to repair harm while maintaining community safety and trust.

We recognize that violations can have disproportionate impact. Behaviors that may seem minor to some community members can have a significantly greater impact on those from marginalized or underrepresented groups who face these patterns repeatedly. We take this into account when addressing incidents.

The enforcement ladder includes the following levels:

1. **Warning** - A private, written warning from the Code of Conduct Working Group.
2. **Temporary Suspension (Short-term)** - A temporary suspension from Django community spaces for a defined period (typically 30-90 days).
3. **Temporary Suspension (Extended)** - An extended temporary suspension for a longer defined period (typically 90 days or more) with specific conditions for return.
4. **Permanent Ban** - Permanent removal from all Django community spaces, tools, and communication channels.

This enforcement ladder is intended as a guideline. It does not limit the ability of the Code of Conduct Working Group to use their discretion and judgment, in keeping with the best interests of our community.

For complete details about our enforcement process, please see our [Enforcement Guide](enforcement-ladder.md).

## Responsible Use of AI-Generated Content

It's essential to use generative AI technologies thoughtfully and in alignment with our shared values of integrity, respect, and authenticity.

When using generative AI to contribute to the community:

- **Take ownership of your contributions.** You are responsible for the content you share.
- **Review and revise AI-generated responses before posting.** Ensure they reflect your own understanding and voice.
- **Apply your expertise** to validate that the information is accurate, relevant, and helpful.

These practices support a community built on trust, collaboration, and mutual respect. Misuse of AI-generated content is a violation of our Code of Conduct.
