# Django Code of Conduct - Enforcement Ladder

The following enforcement ladder may be used to determine how best to
address a Code of Conduct violation with the goal of repairing harm. The
working group will consider the incident's impact on individuals involved
and the community as a whole. Depending on the severity of a violation,
lower levels may be skipped.

## 1. Warning

**Event:** A violation involving a single incident or series of
incidents.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from the working group,
providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation
of why the behavior was inappropriate.

**Suggested Behavioral Modifications:** May include requesting the person
refrain from specific language or discussion topics, cease direct contact
with specific individuals, or adjust their communication style.

**Opportunities for Repair:** The person may be asked to provide a
private written apology, acknowledge responsibility for their actions,
and demonstrate understanding of community expectations.

## 2. Temporary Suspension (Short-term)

**Event:** A repeated violation after a warning, or a first instance of a
more serious violation.

**Consequence:** A temporary suspension from Django community spaces for
a defined period (typically 30-90 days, determined by the working group
based on the circumstances). During this period, no interaction with
Django community spaces or members is permitted, including unsolicited
interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct. At the conclusion
of the suspension period, the individual must request readmission to
Django community spaces.

**Suggested Behavioral Modifications:** May include restrictions on
participating in specific channels or discussions, requirements not to
contact certain individuals, or removal from moderator/leadership roles
upon return.

**Opportunities for Repair:** The individual should use this time to
reflect on their actions and impact. They may be asked to demonstrate
understanding of what behavior changes are needed before the suspension
ends. An apology or acknowledgment of harm may be requested. The request
for readmission should demonstrate reflection and commitment to changed
behavior.

## 3. Temporary Suspension (Extended)

**Event:** A repeated violation after a short-term suspension, ongoing
problematic behavior, or a serious single violation.

**Consequence:** An extended temporary suspension from all Django
community spaces for a longer defined period (typically 90 days or more).
The working group may set specific conditions for return, such as
demonstrating changed behavior or completing specific actions. At the
conclusion of the suspension period, the individual must request
readmission to Django community spaces.

**Suggested Behavioral Modifications:** May include permanent removal from
leadership or moderator positions, restrictions on which spaces they may
participate in, required supervision or mentorship upon return, or
prohibitions on specific types of interactions.

**Opportunities for Repair:** Before the suspension ends, the individual
must meet any conditions set by the working group. This may include
providing a written statement about lessons learned, outlining how they
will change their behavior, or other restorative actions. The request for
readmission must demonstrate that all conditions have been met. The
working group will evaluate readiness to return thoughtfully.

## 4. Permanent Ban

**Event:** A pattern of repeated violations that other steps on the
enforcement ladder have failed to address, or a single violation so
serious that the working group determines there is no way to maintain
community safety with this person as a member.

**Consequence:** Permanent removal from all Django community spaces,
tools, and communication channels. The individual may also be prohibited
from participating in Django events.

**Repair:** Permanent bans are a last resort and indicate that other
remediation efforts have been exhausted or that the violation is too
severe to allow continued participation.

## Additional Resolution Options

The working group may also employ the following responses:

- Taking no further action if the working group determines no violation
  occurred or that the issue is better addressed through other means.
- Facilitated communication between parties when appropriate and when all
  parties consent.
- Referral to the Online Community Working Group for ongoing monitoring
  or support within specific spaces.

The working group maintains records of all resolutions so that they may
be reviewed in the future, extended to new Django spaces, or otherwise
maintained.
