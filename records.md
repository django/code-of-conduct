# Django Code of Conduct

## Record-keeping
Regardless of the outcome, we note each report and outcome in our records, with
the following fields:

 * __Date of 1st report.__ for time-tracking
 * __Reporter, if official/public, CoC person if private.__ We do not name 
 private reporters here, but the CoC representative handling the case instead
 * __Named subjects.__ The people or usernames who prompted the report.
 * __Subject email address/URL.__
 * __Summary of report (for internal purposes).__ A confidential summary of the 
 nature of the report
 * __Action taken by us?__ Anything involving contacting the subject of the 
 report counts as action
 * __Action taken by local rep?__ Often the reports are handled satisfactorily 
 by community organizers.
 * __Summary of outcome to share if suitable.__ This is written for sharing 
 with community organizers, assuming it may be read by the subject of the 
 report, and so should be objective and privacy-respecting.
 * __Banned or flagged.__ "flagged" means we will share the summary 
 outcome of the report with event organizers; "banned" means that the 
 information will include that we have asked the person not to attend events 
 covered by the CoC. Banned is a subclass of flagged.
 * __Date to expunge this record.__ When this date is exceeded, we replace 
 identifying information in the record with "Expunged", with the idea that 
 the report isn't to affect our dealings with this person after this date. 
 For reports that seem to be minor, or one-offs, or that weren't upheld, this 
 date is 6 or 12 months in the future. For reports that seem more serious, or 
 repeat violations, there is no expunge date. The date resets if we receive 
 further reports about any individuals concerned.

These records are used to form our [statistics](statistics.md).

## Data retention of records

 Records are currently stored in a Google Spreadsheet and shared between
members of the committee only. The committee insists on not sharing the
records outside the members due to confidentiality of information. Violating
this will result in removal of the member from the committee.

Once a member steps down from the committee, their access to the records is
removed. Newly added committee member receives access to all previous records
too. 

## Information from e-mails

Members only have access to e-mails incoming to conduct@djangoproject.com
whilst they are members of the committee.

## Slack

Slack is not used for discussing sensitive information, only for quick
coordination of actions.
