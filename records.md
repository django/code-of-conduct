# Django Code of Conduct

## Record-keeping
Regardless of the outcome, we note each report and outcome in our records, with
the following fields:

 * __Date of 1st report.__ for time-tracking
 * __Reporter, if official/public, CoC person if private.__ We do not name 
 private reporters here, but the CoC representative handling the case instead
 * __Named subjects.__ The people or usernames who prompted the report.
 * __Subject email address/URL.__
 * __Summary of report (for internal purposes).__ A confidential summary of the 
 nature of the report
 * __Action taken by us?__ Anything involving contacting the subject of the 
 report counts as action
 * __Action taken by local rep?__ Often the reports are handled satisfactorily 
 by community organizers.
 * __Summary of outcome to share if suitable.__ This is written for sharing 
 with community organizers, assuming it may be read by the subject of the 
 report, and so should be objective and privacy-respecting.
 * __Banned or flagged.__
 * __Date to expunge this record.__ 

These records are used to form our [statistics](statistics.md).

## Data retention of records

 Records are currently stored in a Google Spreadsheet and shared between
members of the committee only. The committee insists on not sharing the
records outside the members due to confidentiality of information. Violating
this will result in removal of the member from the committee.

Once a member steps down from the committee, their access to the records is
removed. Newly added committee member receives access to all previous records
too. 

## Flagged and banned status in committee records

The committee records all reported incidents, regardless of who reported them, who handled them, or whether they were found to be a violation. Records can be grouped in one of five types:

* The committee assessed no violation occurred.
* The committee determined a violation occurred, but it is not possible to identify the bad actors.
* A violation occurred and was resolved as far as the committee is concerned.
* A violation occurred and the person/record is flagged, due to concern about their behaviour in the future.
* A violation occurred, and the person is banned temporarily or permanently.

Flagging is a specific scenario, where the violation was dealt with,
but the committee feels there is a risk that this person may commit 
further violations in the future. However, the concern is not great 
enough to ban the person. This may be the case if someone responded 
very poorly to a message from the committee, and did not seem to 
acknowledge that their behaviour needs to change. Another example 
could be a person who drank very excessively at a conference party 
and caused unpleasant situations for other attendees.

The committee may provide further suggestions on how to best manage
this person’s attendance. In the example of excessive alcohol, the 
conference team might then decide to allow the person to attend the 
conference, but not the party, or to allow them to attend the party 
but forbid any alcohol consumption. For people who responded poorly 
to the Code of Conduct process in the past, it may be appropriate to 
have a conversation with them about this, and then decide whether 
and how they can be part of a conference.

This is in contrast to people who are not flagged, but did violate the 
CoC: in this case the committee feels there is no particular risk of 
further violations, and it would be excessive to notify conferences 
of their history.

In summary, to flag a person/record means: “if this person attends a 
conference, or otherwise participates in the community, it would be 
irresponsible if the committee did not inform the conference of their 
past behaviour, and allowed the organisers to consider extra precautions”.

## Retention terms of records
The following default retention terms apply to records:

* The committee assessed no violation occurred: no retention
* The committee determined a violation occurred, but it is not 
  possible to identify the bad actors: 6 months retention of 
  reporter information, permanent retention of other information
* A violation occurred and was resolved as far as the committee 
  is concerned: 14 months retention
* A violation occurred and the person/record is flagged, due to 
  concern about their behaviour in the future: 26 months retention
* A violation occurred, and the person is banned temporarily or 
  permanently: retention for the period of the ban, plus 26 months

After the retention term, personally identifiable information of 
both reporter and bad actor will be removed. General information 
about the incident will remain.

Due to the roughly yearly scheduling of Django conferences, which 
are a source of a large part of the Code of Conduct reports, a 
repeat offender is likely to only re-occur in the reports after 
about a year, even if their behaviour is consistently an issue.
Therefore, the retention term for case 3 is basically “until after 
the next DjangoCon in that region” and for case 4 and 5 it is
“until after the next two DjangoCons in that region”.

If a person commits a new violation, this extends the retention 
term for all previous non-expunged records as well. The committee 
can deviate from the retention terms in exceptional circumstances.

## Information from e-mails

Members only have access to e-mails incoming to conduct@djangoproject.com
whilst they are members of the committee.

## Slack

Slack is not used for discussing sensitive information, only for quick
coordination of actions.
