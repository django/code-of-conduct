# Django Code of Conduct - Enforcement Manual

This is the enforcement manual followed by Django's Code of Conduct Working Group.
It's used when we respond to an issue to make sure we're consistent and fair.
It should be considered an internal document, but we're publishing it publicly in
the interests of transparency.

## The Code of Conduct Working Group

All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed by the
[Code of Conduct Working Group](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#code-of-conduct-team).

The Django Software Foundation's Board of Directors ("the board")
will establish this working group, comprised of at least three members.
One member will be designated chair of the working group and will be
responsible for all reports back to the board. The board will review
membership on a regular basis.

## Coordination with Online Community Working Group

The [Online Community Working Group](https://github.com/django/dsf-working-groups/blob/main/active/online-community.md)
handles day-to-day moderation of Django's online spaces and has flexibility to
address minor infractions within those spaces using their own moderation processes.

The Code of Conduct Working Group becomes involved when:

- A formal report is submitted directly to the Code of Conduct Working Group
- A violation occurs across multiple Django spaces
- The Online Community Working Group escalates an issue that requires formal Code of Conduct enforcement
- An issue at a Django event or sponsored event is escalated to the working group

Each working group designates a liaison from its own members to facilitate
coordination and communication between the groups.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Django project or
Django Software Foundation, including but not limited to:

- The Django Forum
- GitHub repositories and issue trackers
- Mailing lists
- Discord, IRC, and other chat platforms
- Social media accounts
- DSF events and Django community events

The Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing
the Django community in public spaces. Examples of official representation include:

- Using an official Django email address
- Posting via an official Django social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Speaking or presenting as a Django representative

### Sponsored Events

Django-sponsored events (such as DjangoCon conferences) are required to have
their own Code of Conduct. Issues at sponsored events can be escalated to the
Code of Conduct Working Group by:

- The event's code of conduct team
- The reporter
- The reported party

The Code of Conduct Working Group will coordinate with event organizers to
determine appropriate responses that respect both the event's autonomy and
Django's community standards.

## How the working group will respond to reports

When a report is sent to the working group, they will immediately reply
to the report to confirm receipt. The working group strives to respond
promptly, recognizing that as volunteers, coordination may take time. The
working group will keep the reporter informed of progress and any delays.

See the [reporting guidelines](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/reporting/)
for details of what reports should contain. If a report doesn't contain
enough information, the working group will obtain all relevant data
before acting. The working group is empowered to act on the DSF's
behalf in contacting any individuals involved to get a more complete
account of events.

The working group will then review the incident and determine, to the
best of their ability:

- what happened
- whether this event constitutes a code of conduct violation
- who, if anyone, was the bad actor
- whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to
  anyone's physical safety

This information will be collected in writing. The working group documents
its deliberations through email discussions, notes and takeaways from
meetings, and by recording decisions from DSF Slack conversations into
their notes.

### Evaluating Reports

When reviewing an incident, the working group will evaluate three key aspects:

#### Jurisdiction

- Is this behavior explicitly listed in our Code of Conduct as inappropriate?
- Did this occur within a space covered by our Code of Conduct's scope?
- If the incident occurred outside Django spaces but may negatively impact a community member's safety or wellbeing, should it be considered in scope?

#### Impact

- Did this incident occur publicly or privately? Public incidents affect more community members.
- Does this behavior negatively impact people from marginalized groups in our community?
- How is the harmed party being negatively impacted?
- Are community members likely to disengage if no action is taken?
- Does this incident involve a community leader whose behavior sets standards for others?

#### Risk

- Does this incident involve sexual harassment or threats to physical safety?
- Will this incident severely impact someone's mental health or physical safety?
- Is there a risk of repeated behavior? Does the reported person understand why their behavior was inappropriate?
- Is there an established pattern from past reports?

Reports involving higher risk or impact may warrant more serious consequences than those with lower risk or impact.

The working group should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within a
reasonable timeframe. If a resolution requires more time, the working group
will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for
resolution.

When communicating with all parties involved, the working group should follow
the [Communications Guidelines](communications.md), which provide detailed
guidance on protecting reporters, using trauma-informed language, engaging
with reported parties, and handling sensitive conversations about repair and
accountability.

## Record Keeping and Privacy

### Record Retention

The working group maintains records of all information and communications
related to incident reports, including:

- Initial reports and all communications with reporters
- Investigation materials and evidence
- Email discussions and documented deliberations
- Notes and key takeaways from meetings
- Decisions made in DSF Slack (recorded into meeting notes)
- Communications with all involved parties
- Final resolutions and any follow-up actions

Records are retained in accordance with the Django Software Foundation's
data retention policies and applicable privacy laws.

### Access to Records

All members of the working group involved in handling a specific incident
report have access to all records related to that report. This ensures
informed decision-making. The board may request access to records for
oversight purposes.

### Privacy Policy Commitments

The working group is committed to protecting the privacy and personal
information of all parties involved in Code of Conduct matters. Personal
data is:

- Stored securely with access limited to working group members
- Used only for the purpose of investigating and resolving reports
- Retained only as long as necessary
- Protected in accordance with applicable data protection regulations

## Confidentiality

### Protection of Reporter and Harmed Individual

The identity of the reporter and any harmed individual(s) must be kept
strictly confidential. This information will not be shared beyond the working
group members handling the case, except:

- When necessary to conduct the investigation
- When required for immediate safety interventions
- When required by law

### Protection of the Accused

The identity of the accused individual should be kept confidential during
the investigation and resolution process. However, implementing certain
decisions may require sharing limited information beyond the working group,
such as:

- Communicating a ban to community moderators
- Taking immediate action to prevent ongoing harm
- Responding to public statements by the accused

When the accused individual chooses to discuss the matter publicly, the
obligation of confidentiality toward them is reduced. However, the working
group will still:

- Maintain confidentiality about the reporter and harmed individuals
- Not make any public statements (any public statements are made by the DSF Board)
- Avoid retaliatory or excessive disclosures

In all cases, information sharing should be limited to what is strictly
necessary to address the situation and implement the resolution. The working
group does not comment publicly on incidents; if public statements are necessary,
they are made by the DSF Board.

## Conflicts of Interest

Any member of the working group must immediately notify the other members
in writing (by disclosure on the report email thread) and recuse themselves
from handling a report if they:

- Are involved in the incident itself
- Have a personal relationship with any involved party
- Work for the same employer as an involved party
- Have access to private information that could bias their judgment
- Have any other conflict of interest that could affect their impartiality

If a report concerns a possible violation by a current working group member,
that member must be excluded from the response process. For these cases,
anyone can make a report directly to any of the other working group members,
as documented in the [reporting guidelines](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/reporting/).

## Acting Unilaterally

If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment in an online
space), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence),
any working group member may act immediately (before reaching consensus) to
end the situation. In ongoing situations, any member may at their discretion
employ any of the tools available to the working group, including bans and
blocks.

If the incident involves physical danger, any member of the working
group must act unilaterally to protect safety. This can include contacting
law enforcement (or other local personnel) and speaking on behalf of the DSF.

In situations where an individual working group member acts unilaterally,
they must report their actions to the working group for review within 24 hours.

## Resolutions

The working group must agree on a resolution by consensus. Where consensus
cannot be reached, decisions may be made by a two-thirds majority vote of
working group members without a conflict of interest. If the working group
cannot reach consensus or a sufficient majority within a reasonable timeframe,
the working group will turn the matter over to the board for resolution.

### Enforcement Ladder

Our [Enforcement Ladder](enforcement-ladder.md) may be used to determine how best
to address a Code of Conduct violation with the goal of repairing harm. The
working group will consider the incident's impact on individuals involved and
the community as a whole. Depending on the severity of a violation, lower levels
may be skipped.

## Feedback from Affected Parties

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the working
group will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and
explain the proposed resolution. The working group will ask if this resolution
is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record.

However, the working group is not required to act on this feedback. The final
decision rests with the working group, using their best judgment to balance
the needs of the affected parties with the safety and health of the broader
community.

## Reporting to the Board

Finally, the working group will make a report for the DSF board via the board liason. In case
the incident or report involves a current member of the board, the
working group will provide the report only to the other board members.

## Transparency and Public Accountability

The working group will never publicly discuss specific incidents. All public
statements about individual Code of Conduct matters will be made by the DSF
board, if deemed necessary.

However, to demonstrate that the Code of Conduct is being actively and fairly
enforced, the working group will publish annual transparency reports including
anonymized statistics such as:

- Number of reports received
- Types of violations reported
- General outcomes (warnings, suspensions, bans)
- Any trends or patterns observed

These reports will be prepared in a way that protects the confidentiality of
all involved parties while providing community accountability.
